# 5-Stage Pipelined Processor and Assembler
This repository contains the implementation of a 5-stage pipelined processor and its corresponding assembler, designed primarily in VHDL. The design aims to mimic a real-world CPU pipeline, including components for fetching, decoding, executing, memory access, and write-back stages, along with associated hazard detection and control units.

## Processor Design Overview
The processor architecture is built around a 5-stage pipeline, allowing for increased instruction throughput. Each stage is designed to perform specific tasks, and files corresponding to each stage are organized within their respective directories.

## Pipeline Stages
1. *Fetch*: Responsible for fetching the next instruction from memory.
2. *Decode*: Decodes the fetched instruction and prepares necessary signals and data paths for execution.
3. *Execute*: Executes the operation specified by the instruction.
4. *Memory*: Handles data memory access, including load and store instructions.
5. *Writeback*: Completes the instruction by writing results back to registers

## Processor Components
- PC (Program Counter)
- Fetch Unit
- Decode Unit (Including various register components)
- Execute Unit (Including ALU, CCR - Condition Code Register)
- Data Memory
- Writeback Unit
- Branch Handling
- Controller Unit
- Hazard Detection Unit (HDU)
- Forwarding Unit
- Stack Pointer (SP)

# Assembler
Included is a Python-based assembler (`assembler.py`) that translates assembly code into machine code understood by the processor. An example assembly file (`example.txt`) is also provided to demonstrate usage.
